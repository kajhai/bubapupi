HERE is Edward Bear, coming downstairs now, bump, bump,    
bump, on the back of his head, behind Christopher Robin. It is,   
as far as  he  knows,  the  only  way of coming downstairs, but   
sometimes he feels that there really is another way, if only he   
could stop bumping for a moment and think of it.   

And then he feels that  perhaps  there  isn't.  Anyhow,   
here  he  is  at the bottom, and ready to be introduced to you.   
Winnie-the-Pooh.

 When I first heard his name, I said, just  as  you  are    
going to say, "But I thought he was a boy?"   

"So did I," said Christopher Robin.   

"Then you can't call him Winnie?"   

"I don't."   

"But you said -- "   

"He's  Winnie-ther-Pooh.  Don't  you  know  what 'ther'
means?"   

"Ah, yes, now I do," I said quickly; and I hope you  do   
too, because it is all the explanation you are going to get.   

Sometimes  Winnie-the-Pooh  likes  a  game of some sort   
when he comes downstairs, and sometimes he likes to sit quietly   
in front of the fire and listen to a story. This evening --   

"What about a story?" said Christopher Robin.   

"What about a story?" I said.   

"Could you very sweetly tell Winnie-the-Pooh one?"   

"I suppose I could," I said. "What sort of stories does
he like?"   

"About himself. Because he's that sort of Bear."   

"Oh, I see."    

"So could you very sweetly?"    

"I'll try," I said.    

So I tried.
